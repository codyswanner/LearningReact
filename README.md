# React

This repository is to hold the code I write as I work along with a ReactJS tutorial found on Skillsoft Percipio.
This course is based on react@16.7.0 and babel-standalone@6.26.0.
I am aware there have been some major updates since this tutorial was recorded; for the sake of following along with the tutorial, I am following closely with the code shown in the tutorial, despite updated best practices.
I plan to learn about features and best practices of the new updates after finishing the tutorial series.

Many of the pages in this repository are exactly as instructed in the tutorial, and some have been altered for the sake of creativity, staving off boredom, and further learning.

At the same time I am working through this tutorial, I am working with a friend on a project that uses ReactJS to store and sort photos.
This project will incorporate a full stack of development and will lean on Microsoft Azure for much of the backend, hosting and storage.
If/when that project has a publicly facing link, I will add it here.

If you have comments/tips for me, feel free to reach out!  I am always happy to learn and acquire new knowledge.
